# bayesian-optimisation
Bayesian optimisation machine learning algorithm in Python.

Analysis of one and two dimensional problems based on simulated data.
Please refer to quick 1D example to explore how GPyOpt package is leveraged to calculate and illustrate optimisation results. 
For more complex analysis, please refer to two-dimensional problem.
Lastly, for an in depth analyis of theory behind Bayesian optimisation using Gaussian proccesses, please refer to full analysis-thesis.pdf
